# *Shellrvision*

**Shellrvision** is a simplified shell that recognizes three built-in commands: cd, status, and exit. 
Other commands are forked and handled either as foreground or background processes.

To run this program:

1.  First type 'make' to compile using the makefile (ignore the gcc warnings)
2.  Type 'smallsh' to run the program (or '/smallsh')
